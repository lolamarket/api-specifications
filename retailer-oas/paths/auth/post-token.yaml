  summary: Generate an access token
  description: |
    Returns a new access token.

    The access token must be included in all other requests as a Bearer token for authentication purposes.
    
    Before you start, make sure you have been given a `clientId` and `clientSecret`.

    The token is valid for 1 hours. During this period, reuse the same token. After that, a new token must be generated.
